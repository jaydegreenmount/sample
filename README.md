# sample
Sample of CRUD PHP code I created.

This is a sample of what I created, during my diploma in web development as my second term assessment. 

As a team, my class and I created a backend for a 'game studio'. 

I created the customer code while working along side other students. We had to speak to the 'stakeholder' to then create a suitable database for the clients needs. 

Working in an Agile work process we had weekly sprints, regular meetings and the team leaders role was past every two weeks, so we all had responsibility while creating this project.
